only up to A11 is wired right now

The delay for the 32k, type 2, is wrong, its set to 10ms 
  instead of 50ms
  
I'm leaving off with the need to build a 50ms personality module

and another personality module for 25V

currently able to program 2716 (be carefull of programming voltage and time)
2816 and some 2732's


use files /mf/p/c/romtooler/
